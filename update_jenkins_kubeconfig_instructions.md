# Instructions to Regenerate or Update Jenkins Kubeconfig for Minikube

The Jenkins pipeline is failing due to authentication errors with the Kubernetes API server. This usually means the kubeconfig file used by Jenkins has invalid or expired credentials.

Follow these steps to regenerate or update the kubeconfig file for Jenkins:

1. On the machine where minikube is running (your local machine), run the following command to get the current kubeconfig content:
   ```
   minikube kubeconfig
   ```
   *Note: If `minikube kubeconfig` is not available, you can copy the kubeconfig file from the default location:*
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.kube\config`
   - Linux/macOS: `~/.kube/config`

2. Copy the entire content of the kubeconfig file.

3. On the Jenkins machine (or wherever Jenkins is running), replace the content of the kubeconfig file at:
   ```
   C:\jenkins\.kube\config
   ```
   with the copied content from step 2.

4. Ensure the `server` field in the kubeconfig points to the correct minikube API server URL (e.g., `https://127.0.0.1:54594`).

5. Verify the client certificate and key paths in the kubeconfig are accessible by Jenkins. If they reference local user paths, copy the certificate and key files to a location accessible by Jenkins and update the kubeconfig paths accordingly.

6. Test the kubeconfig by running the following command on the Jenkins machine:
   ```
   kubectl --kubeconfig=C:\jenkins\.kube\config get pods
   ```
   It should list the pods without authentication errors.

7. Restart the Jenkins pipeline and verify the deployment step succeeds.

## Alternative: Use a Kubernetes Service Account for Jenkins

If you want a more robust solution, create a Kubernetes service account with appropriate RBAC permissions and configure Jenkins to use its token for authentication.
